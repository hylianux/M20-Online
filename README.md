# M20JS

This repository contains the server code needed to run Microlite20JS.  

## Requirements

You'll need NodeJS ***(version?)*** and NPM ***(version?)***

## Install and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hylianux/M20JS.git
npm install
node index.js
```
This will download and install everything, and get the app running on port 3120.

If 3120 is not a good port, you can change it in the server-config.js file.
